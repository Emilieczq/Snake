# 3D Snake Game - 3GC3 Final Project

## Graphics Features

This snake game includes the following graphics features as explored in class:
### 1. Lighting

We have implemented different lighting options. These include changing the position of the light, by pressing **u, j, h, k**, or by toggling the main scene light.

### 2. Textures

In this game, there are multiple textures being rendered. For example, the entire map that the snake moves on has a grass texture binded to it. Other textures include a stone texture for obstacles, money texture for coins, and water texture for ponds. All of these objects appear on the map, and can be interacted with.

### 3. Alpha Blending

The alpha blending feature is implemented in the game and can be observed when the snake interacts with a pond object. When the snake interacts with the pond, it becomes slightly transparent for one move iteration in whatever direction it's currently travelling in. 

### 4. Picking

How to run: type ```make```
